Prof. Luis Rueda <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> Home Research Publications Teaching People Resources I did my Bachelor of Computer Science from the National University of San Juan, San Juan, Argentina, in 1993, and my Master's and Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, under the supervision of B. John Oommen. I have been with the School of Computer Science at the University of Windsor, Canada, from 2002, when I joined as assistant professor. I am currently a Full Professor in computer science, since my promotion in 2013. My current research interests are mainly focused on devising shallow and deep machine learning algorihtms at the fundamental level and applications to protein-protein interaction and dynamics, transcriptomics, microRNA prediction, integrative genome-wide analysis, and identification of cancer biomarkers. I am a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and a member of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) and the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). I am Associate Editor of Network Modeling Analysis in Health Informatics and Bioinformatics (NetMAHIB). I am also a member of the Technical Committee on Pattern Recognition for Bioinformatics (IAPR TC-20) and the program committees of several conferences. I am a principal investigator of the research group on Machine Learning in Bioinformatics Lab at the University of Windsor. Latest news Mar 10 2019: New journal publicaiton: S. Jubair, A.

Prospective Students I currently have opening positions for undergraduate, Master's and PhD students. Partial financial support is available from the School of Computer Science and the Faculty of Science, in terms of scholarships and teaching assistatnships. Research assistatnships are currently available for outstanding PhD students only. Prospective students at all levels are encouraged to contact me about my short and long-term research projects in shallow and deep machine learning at the fundamental level and with applications to protein-protein interaction and dynamics, transcriptomics, microRNA prediction, integrative genome-wide analysis, and identification of cancer biomarkers. More information for prospective students can be found in the Prospective Students page. Recent Awards Ontario Centres of Excellence -- TalentEdge Award. University of Windsor, 2018.
