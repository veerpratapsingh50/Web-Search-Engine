#Web Search Engine
This application is built using JAVA. 
The Application consists of below functionalities: 
 1. Web Crawler - which is gathering the string tokens from a URL recursively. Currently, we have limited the scope of URL crawling to be 2500. But can easily be changed. 
 2. Inverted Index - We have used the inverted Index to store the Data Dictionary from Web Crawler Output. This is implemented using Trie(for Data Dictionary) and HashMap(Occurrences of Strings in a URL). 
 3. QuickSort - It is used to give the web pages for the searched String.
 4. Analyzing of frequency using HashTable
 5. Use of finding pattern using regular expression.Correct Word recommendation using EDIT Distance Algorithm.
