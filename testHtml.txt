When he came back at 11:30 a.m. he called police.As police responded to his call, the infants were awake in their stroller. While officers investigated, one officer rocked the stroller back and forth, keeping the kidsÂ calm. Of all the people at the scene the kids were the only ones smiling and laughing.At the scene, the woman who police identified as the children’s mother received medical attention from paramedics. Staff Sgt. Jeff Mailloux of the Windsor Police said she was taken to hospital and Children’s Aid Services is involved. Police officers carried the kids out of the apartment building into a waiting ambulance, bringing a blanket and a bag of graham crackers with them.Neighbour Yasmin Farah said she saw the kids at 8:30 a.m. and called the woman she believes is the childrenâ€™s mother who lives in an upstairs apartment.â€œI called the woman upstairs, and said thereâ€™s two kids, why are they there? She said â€˜itâ€™s not your business.â€™â€? Farah said. â€œI donâ€™t know who the woman is. Maybe itâ€™s the mother, she said itâ€™s not your business. It is my business. Itâ€™s two kids. Youâ€™re my neighbour, I see you with the kids before I moved downstairs.â€?After continuing to call the woman, eventually she came downstairs, Farah said, prompting Farah to go back inside her apartment with her family. She came back out of her apartment after police arrived.â€œI saw her sit down and watch the kids, but maybe she left the kids again,â€? said Farah, who only knows the woman to say hello in theÂ  hallways. â€œI came out and saw the police and was scared.â€?With files from Dane WanniarachigeFind Windsor Star on FacebookTags: Crime and Law, Windsor, Windsor Police Connect With UsFacebookTwitterGoogle PlusPinterestTumblrRSSMost PopularMost PopularWindsor woman pleads guilty to indecent act for library peep showsStorm sparks blaze, knocks out power in Windsor, Essex CountyMotorcyclist killed in North Talbot Road crashFord Fireworksâ€™ early start a successCity staff to discuss new policy on traffic calming measuresGrace Macalusoâ€™s Auto TalkThe secrets I still want my teen to learnLeamington man on trial for arson for allegedly burning man out of neighbourhoodWindsor In Pictures: June 22, 2015Earth is on the brink of a sixth mass extinction, scientists say â€¦ and itâ€™s humansâ€™ faultStar Staff TweetsMy TweetsNews AlertsGet the Windsor Star delivered to your inboxSubmitMore Email AlertsLatest VideosCity staff to discuss new policy on traffic calming measuresEver wonder how the city decides which roads get speed bumps and which ones get roundabouts?
